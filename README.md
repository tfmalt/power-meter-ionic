# Power Meter Ionic

This is a hobby experiment with [ionic](ionicframework.com) to create a cordova based dashboard 
app to access data from my [ardunio](www.arduino.cc) based power meter reader.

* See: [power-meter-monitor](https://github.com/tfmalt/power-meter-monitor) for
information about the arduino board and the monitoring daemon that reads data
from the serialport.
* See: [power-meter-api](https://github.com/tfmalt/power-meter-api) For the
restful web service API that provides access to the datasets for this app and
others.
